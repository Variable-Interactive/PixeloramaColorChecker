Helps match colors when choosing a new color for the tool.

### Few pointers:
- The old color slot remains unchanged until you start to actually draw.
- Old color on the left side, new color is on the right.
- User can temporarily hide the matcher by using `Escape` key (this doesn't update the old color and would behave the same unless user draws)
